# Weak Lensing measurements and Parameter Estimation

\[ Code related to project-7 at ICTS school on Cosmology and big data \]

The code sets out to measure the Weak Lensing Signal from objects identified in the [redMaGiC Dataset](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/461/2/1431/2608400), which can then be used to constrain related astrophysical parameters using an MCMC Sampling algorithm. The parameters we set out to constrain are the parameters of the Diemer-Kravstov model for dark-matter halos.
